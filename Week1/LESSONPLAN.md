# Lesson Plan Week 1

## Agenda

The purpose of this class is to introduce to the student (1) the basics of working with the command line interface, and (2) basic HTML/CSS concepts:

FIRST HALF:

- Command line interface basics

SECOND HALF:

- Difference `<head>` and `<body>`
- Semantic HTML5
- The box model

### Core concepts

FIRST HALF (12.00 - 13.30)

1. **Command line interface basics**

- The command line interface (CLI) is a way to navigate your computer by issuing direct commands
- Desktop application icons are visual shortcuts
- Explain concepts of file system, processes, OS and shell in brief

_Show students the most commonly used commands (`ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, `echo`, `cat`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `head`, `tail`)_

SECOND HALF (14.00 - 16.00)

2. **Difference `<head>` and `<body>`**

- The `<head>` holds all the page's meta-data: information about the complete webpage

_Show examples of what the `<head>` could hold and why: `<title>`, `<link>`, `<meta>`_

- The `<body>` holds all the elements that will be displayed in the browser

_Show examples of commonly used HTML tags: `<h1>`, `<a href="#">`, `<div>`_

3. **Semantic HTML5**

- In theory a page can be constructed using only `<div>`s
- Semantic tags make the code more comprehensible
- It helps organize the page

_Show examples of semantic HTML: `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`_

4. **The box model**

- Everything is a box
- The "box" refers to the attributes universal to every element: `margin`, `padding`, `border`
- Every element pushes against one another

_Show example of the box model by using the browser inspector on various elements_
